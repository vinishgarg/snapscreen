It enables fans and viewers to snap the TV/OTT and instantly get a broadcast quality clip to rewind, trim, add effects and text and share. Fans share their personal clips and spread the brand, sponsorship, and drive ratings. Snapscreen is a B2B2C SDK added to TV/OTT apps, mobile websites, and messenger bots.
