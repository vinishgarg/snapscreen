Techstars selected 10 companies that will be joining for the inaugural year of the program. Snapscreen is among them and we are very excited to work with the the Techstars pros! “Like all Techstars accelerators, our goal is simple – we will turbocharge our companies’ development with their customer growth, fundraising, and other fundamental business functions”. That really sounds great, doesn’t it?
